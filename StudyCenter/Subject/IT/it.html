        <h1 class="question">Q1) Explain any five data analysis tools</h1>
        <h1 class="answer">
            a) Consolidate is a function used to combine information from multiple sheets of the spreadsheet into one
            place to summarize the information. It is used to view and compare variety of data in a single spreadsheet
            for identifying trends and relationships
            <br>
            b) The Subtotal tool in Calc creates the group automatically and applies common functions like sum, average
            on the grouped data. It can group subtotals by using category and sorts them in ascending or descending
            order so that one need not to use filters.
            <br>
            c) The Goal Seek tool helps in finding out the input for the specific output. For example, if you want to
            know the number of units produced to get the desired output then use Goal seek analysis tool.
            <br>
            d) What-if scenario is a set of values that can be used within the calculations in the spreadsheet. A name
            is given to the scenario and several scenarios can be created on the same sheet. It is used to explore and
            compare various alternatives depending on changing conditions.
            <br>
            e) A solver component modifies a set of input cells in spreadsheet,observing the impact on result and
            constraint formula cells. the goal is used to find an optimal set of input values,for which the result is
            minimized,maximized or approx to target value while the constraints remain within specified limits.

        <h1 class="question">Q2 a) Give One point difference between a) Subtotal and What-If</h1>
        <h1 class="answer">Subtotals are used to summarize data within a dataset, while What-If scenarios involve
            creating hypothetical situations for analysis.</h1>

        <h1 class="question">Q2 b) Give One point difference between b) What-If Scenario and What-If tool</h1>
        <h1 class="answer">What-If scenarios involve creating hypothetical situations for analysis. The What-If Tool is
            a software feature designed to facilitate the creation and analysis of What-If scenarios.

        <h1 class="answer">A macro is a single instruction that executes a set of
            instructions. These set of instructions can be a sequence
            of commands or keystrokes that can be used for any
            number of times later.
            <br>
            Macros can be used to format cells, cell ranges like changing the font, colour, applying alignment etc.
            They can also be used to perform repeated tasks related to Data Entry.

<h1 class="answer">
	Two advantages of relating a table in database:-<br>
	1. A relationship can help prevent data redundancy. <br>
	2. Any updation in the master table is automatically 
reflected in the transaction tables.
</h1>
	    <hr>
	   <h1 class="question">Q10) How is redundancy or incosistency controlled in a database? Explain with an example.</h1>
<h1 class="answer">
	 Relations are set up between the tables to control 
data redundancy and inconsistency. <br>
	Consider Murugan managing ABC School's data. Two tables are present: Admissions and Library. 'Ram Lal Kumar' wants to change his name to 'Ram Kumar'. Without a DBMS, Murugan must update both tables manually. With a DBMS, a single update in one table automatically reflects in the other, eliminating redundancy and inconsistency.

<h1 class="answer">
	In many-to-many relationship, there will be multiple 
records in the master table that correspond to multiple 
records in the transaction table as well. <br>
	 A shopkeeper may sell multiple 
products to multiple customers. So many-to-many 
relationship exists between a product and a customer.
